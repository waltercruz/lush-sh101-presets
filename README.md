This is the conversion of some patches from Roland SH-101 plugin demo to LuSH-101. Both are emulations of Roland SH-101.

Some remarkable differences:

* Roland plugin offers negative keytrack for the filter. Although D-16 doesn't offer this directly, you can always use the modulation matrix to get the same effect.

* Envelopes on D-16 plugin seems different. For some sounds, I can't really get a punch sound. Don't know really how to fix it.

* Roland has a really good sub and low end, without missing the sharpness on mid-range. If I try to get the same sounds on D-16, I need to add eq on low end. I could get the same sounds with two layers on D-16 plugin, but that would be cheating, like using two SH-101 :)

* Roland plugin has a tone knob that 'Adjusts the brightness of the sound.'. This doesn't seem to exist in hardware SH-101 too.

So, they're similar, but is not that easy to get exactly the same sounds. Sounds with a snap envelope seems hard to get.

You're welcome to fine tune these patches, or talk to me on github or through e-mail: waltercruz@gmail.com.

Have a nice day.
